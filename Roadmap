This file will contain a plaintext list of the planned additions to the program
in the order I plan to implement them.

DONE - Detailed comments to make code more digestible
- Various error handling in functions that currently do not handle errors
DONE - Slight refactoring of functions to make code more reusable
- Rework pkenc.txt file to be harder for user to modify
- Add settings file that modifies programs operation, for example...
- Add Master Key setting that will encrypt pkenc.txt file using AES-256
- Add first time setting which will prompt user slightly different
- When very satisfactory version of SafePass terminal program is made, create IDE version
